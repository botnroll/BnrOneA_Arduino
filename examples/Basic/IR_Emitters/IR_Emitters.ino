Description:
Infra-Red obstacle detection LEDs (IRE1 and IRE2) are switched ON and OFF every second. 
Messages are printed on the LCD and Serial Monitor accordingly.
WARNING!!!
Infra-Red light can damage your eyes if you look to emitting IR LED's.
You will not be able to see the LED's emitting light because human eyes cannot see infra-red light.
You can see the IR LED's light using a camera (from you cell phone or smart-phone, for example).
Placing an obstacle 2cm in front of the LEDS should switch IRS1 and IRS2 ON and OFF.
